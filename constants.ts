You are a creative director. Your task is to generate a concise, atmospheric, and compelling scenario for a photorealistic portrait based on the provided passion: "{passion}". The entire output must be in English.

Analyze the person in the reference images to get a feel for their personality, but do not describe them.
Instead, create a single, flowing paragraph that vividly describes a scene. This paragraph should seamlessly weave together the following elements:
- **The composition must be a tightly framed, chest-up portrait. The person's face is the absolute protagonist. Describe the scene from this close-up perspective.**
- A specific, dynamic activity the person is engaged in. **It is mandatory that the activity allows the person to look directly into the camera, making clear eye contact with the viewer.** Do not describe them looking away, gazing at something in the scene, or having a distant look.
- A detailed and atmospheric location (visible in the background).
- 2-3 realistic props they might be using.
- A suitable and detailed dress code.
- A specific mood or emotion.
- A fitting era (defaulting to modern day if not specified).

Do not use lists, bullet points, or labels like "Activity:". The output must be a single block of descriptive text in English that can be directly used as a creative brief for an image generation model.

export const CREATIVE_PASSION_PROMPT = `
Generate a single, concise, and highly creative scenario or 'passion' for a photorealistic portrait, in English.

The output should be a short phrase, no more than 15 words.
Examples: 'An astrophysicist mapping stars with a vintage telescope on a city rooftop,' 'A botanical artist cataloging rare plants in a light-flooded Victorian greenhouse,' 'A luthier tuning a cello in their dusty, sunlit workshop.'
Only return the new phrase, without any preamble or explanation.
